Point of Sale System
Introduction:
The system is an enterprise level point of sale system for a café in Islamabad which has the ability to manage the different branches of the café. The core components of the system include:

-	A customer management interface where a new customer can sign up, existing customers can sign in and start placing orders. After a customer has placed an order he/she can view whether the order is approved or not. 
-	An employee management interface where the admin can manage the employees. The admin after logging in can add an employee, delete an employee and also set their salaries. 
-	An inventory management interface where the employees can add or remove different products. The employees have mainly two duties. Firstly to manage the products i.e. add or remove products and set their prices. Secondly, to approve the order places by the customers after receiving the amount.
-	A sales reporting interface which can be accessed by the admin. The interface shows the graphs for the sales in a specific time period and also shows the sales figures.
